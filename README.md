JMSSerializerModule
===================

Zend Framework2 integration for the [jms serializer library](https://github.com/schmittjoh/serializer)

:warning: This Project Has Been Deprecated :warning:
====================================================

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this module. Unfortunately, **I
do not plan to continue maintaining it.**

The Zend Framework [is now called Laminas](https://www.zend.com/blog/evolution-zend-framework-laminas-project), and
a lot has changed since then. Also I do not actively use this framework, which makes it kinda hard to keep it up2date.

Feel free to use this module as-is, but it won't receive any updates from my side.
